picom is a standalone compositor for Xorg, suitable for use with window managers that do not provide compositing. picom is a fork of compton, which is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, which in turn is a fork of xcompmgr. and you can see arch wiki manual <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Picom">here</a> and github page <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">here</a>.<br>
you can install it from your package manager easily.<br>
